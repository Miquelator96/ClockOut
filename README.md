In this repository there are most of the script that I either contributed in or fully programmed myself in C# for the mobile game ClockOut!!

Some of the scripts' goals are:

- Creating a randomized enemy roster for each playthrough, prioritizing those enemies the player has not yet encountered.
- Creating a modular mechanic system, making each fight experience to be easily customizable by modifying player and enemy’s available actions.
- Using events to communicate between scripts actions taking by both the player and NPC such as blocking, taking damage, being exhausted, etc.
- Creating a reactive AI system, implementing a finite state machine that evaluates the fight’s state and reacts to the player’s punches and blocks while at the same time remaining fair and engaging.
